###Predicting fake news from real news
##Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify news articles as either "true" or "fake". The goal is to assist in combating misinformation by accurately identifying fake news articles.

##Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of news articles labeled as true or fake. It includes features such as the text and title of the news articles.

##Key Features:
Text: The content of the news article.

##Title: 
The title of the news article.

##Label: 
Indicates whether the news article is true (1) or fake (0).

##Project Workflow
###1. Data Preprocessing
Loaded and inspected the dataset.

Handled missing values and duplicates.

Generated word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in true and fake news articles.

###2. Data Visualization
Created word clouds to visualize common words in true and fake news articles.

###3. Feature Extraction
Used TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert the text and title into numerical features.

###4. Model Training
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Trained multiple classifiers:

Decision Tree (DTC)

Random Forest (RFC)

AdaBoost (ABC)

Bagging

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

###5. Model Evaluation
Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Compared the performance of different classifiers to identify the best-performing model.

##Results:
The Random Forest classifier showed the best performance among the models tested.

##Future Work:
Hyperparameter Tuning: Further improve model performance.

##Feature Engineering: 
Explore additional features for better classification.

##Model Interpretation: 
Use techniques like SHAP values to interpret model predictions and understand feature importance.
